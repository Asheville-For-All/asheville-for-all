<p>In cities across North America, we tend to have small downtowns with very large buildings, surrounded by very large areas with very small buildings.</p>
<p>That is, we often only have two extremes: high-rises, and detached single-family homes.</p>
<p>But it turns out that some of the most desirable neighborhoods in the country, ones that tend to have been built before the mid-20th century, look like something in between.</p>

<p>The kinds of housing in these neighborhoods are the &ldquo;missing middle.&rdquo; As you can see on the image above, they are in the &ldquo;middle&rdquo; of a spectrum of various densities and heights.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re &ldquo;missing&rdquo; because after World War II, places like Asheville gave their land use almost exclusively over to sprawled out, single-family homes.</p>
<h2>How Did &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; Housing Go &ldquo;Missing&rdquo; Exactly?</h2>
<p>The reason why homes such as duplexes, quadplexes, triple-deckers, townhouses, and small apartment buildings went &ldquo;missing&rdquo; is a big story. But at least some of the reason can be boiled down to the phrase: &ldquo;exclusionary zoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, residents of some neighborhoods determined that they could make their communities more <em>exclusive</em> by restricting local land use. Banning multi-family homes, imposing mandatory setbacks and minimum lot sizes, and setting other restrictions meant that it would be harder for poor people to find homes in such neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This was segregation by another name. In many municipalities across the country, these new zoning restrictions were literally promoted by segregationists.</p>
<p>And after the Civil Rights Movement made formal residential segregation illegal, exclusionary zoning went into overdrive. Many city neighborhoods—including some in Asheville—were <em>downzoned</em>.</p>
<p>To some, this didn&rsquo;t seem like a big deal at the time. The federal government was subsidizing our petroleum-dependent economy and our car-dependent lifestyles. The creation of sprawling new subdivisions seemed like the answer to the problems that exclusionary zoning posed.</p>
<h2>What Are the Drawbacks When &ldquo;Middle&rdquo; Housing is &ldquo;Missing&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s clear now that the long-term effects of exclusionary zoning are two-fold.</p>
<p>First, as the nation&rsquo;s population inevitably grows, the capacity of a city to hold people doesn&rsquo;t grow with it. Exclusionary zoning freezes places in time, even though cities by their nature need to change. (And of course when places are <em>downzoned,</em> their potential population capacity is <em>reduced.</em>)</p>
<p>This is especially bad in places that are desirable. It&rsquo;s natural for us to want to live near jobs, amenities, sites of culture, commerce, and connection. When we cordon such places off from density, we get a mismatch between housing supply and housing demand in such places. And as a consequence, land values go through the roof.</p>
<p>Remember, this was all part of the plan. If land values are high, and lots can&rsquo;t be shrunk, sub-divided, or put to use by multiple families at once, you can keep poor and less affluent people out of your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Second, exclusionary zoning deepens car dependency, necessitating more and more greenhouse gas emissions as working people and their families are pushed further and further away from job centers. When we can&rsquo;t build homes for our growing population near downtown or other locations close to jobs and amenities, we&rsquo;re forced to do it in parts of the region that we&rsquo;d rather protect and preserve. The result is not just sprawl, but choked highways and long commutes too.</p>
<h2>What Do You Mean by <em>MORE</em> Missing Middle?</h2>
<p>The title of this page says &ldquo;more&rdquo; missing middle, because although a missing-middle inspired reform of our zoning code could potentially have fantastic effects, we also want to stress that neighborhoods all over Asheville have <em>long</em> featured &ldquo;middle&rdquo; housing types.</p>

<figcaption class="figure-caption">Many of Asheville’s older, more walkable neighborhoods include a mix of single-family and multi-family homes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Opponents of upzoning and land use reforms, especially those that live in neighborhoods with only single-family homes, will often suggest that these kinds of homes are incompatible with multi-family homes. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine even a four-unit apartment or condominium building amidst a sea of single-family homes, when that sea of single-family homes surrounds you.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s nothing radical about single-family homes living next to apartments. Or townhomes. Old Asheville neighborhoods are full of such configurations.</p>
