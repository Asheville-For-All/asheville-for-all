## About Us

Asheville For All is a volunteer-run grassroots organization, and was established in Spring of 2022.
    
We're led by Asheville area residents who are deeply concerned about housing scarcity and the lack of housing choice and affordability that come with it.

There are no businesses, lobbyists, interest groups, or venture capitalists funding our efforts. We take no marching orders, except from Asheville area community members desperate for more housing options and lower costs.

Our power lies with people like you. Stay up to date on what you can do for housing abundance by filling out the email form on the [“Stay Connected” page](stay-connected.html).

Asheville For All is a chapter of [YIMBY Action](https://yimbyaction.org), a nationwide network fighting for housing abundance. Becoming a member of YIMBY Action automatically makes you a member of Asheville For All. [Join today!](join.html)
