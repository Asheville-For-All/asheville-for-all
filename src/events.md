### August 7th - In-Person Meetup

Come join and meet your fellow pro-housing Ashevilleans!

Any and all are welcome. We'll be gathering at Riverside Rhapsody Brewery in North Asheville, from 1pm-3pm, on Sunday August 7th. Nothing formal, just a chance to hang out, meet people, and talk about housing in Asheville.

If you fill out the RSVP form below to let us know that you're planning to come, then we can send you an email reminder the day before. And we can better keep you informed on any last minute details too.
