    <h2>Glossary of Housing Related Terms</h2>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="developer">Developer</h3>

    <p>For our purposes, developers are people or corporations that build houses. Every house in Asheville was "developed" by someone, at some time. Some buildings are developed by a single person, or a group of friends that pool their money. Others are built by large for-profit entities.</p>

    <p>If you spend some time listening to discussions about housing in Asheville, you will probably hear someone get angry about "greedy developers." But as the population of Asheville—and the country overall—increases, we need more housing to be built, in places close to jobs, amenities, and existing communities. We need builders, or "developers," to do this.</p>

    <p>Now, we at Asheville For All are not market fundamentalists. But we are keenly aware of the double standard evident when people with existing housing wealth, homeowners that are satisfied with the status quo, use "developers" as a kind of scapegoat for why new housing can't be built—new housing that would ease rent and home costs for struggling residents by increasing supply to meet demand. After all, homeowners' houses were built by developers too.</p>

    <p>Many advocates of <a href="#upzoning">upzoning</a> point out that if we were to eliminate <a href="#exclusionary-zoning">exclusionary zoning</a> and other prohibitions againt building <a href="#missing-middle">missing middle housing</a> by right, this would favor small developers looking to build small projects, like duplexes, quadplexes, or courtyard complexes. That's because currently, building new multi-family construction in Asheville is so difficult. Because of the zoning in place, only deep-pocketed developers are able to navigate the tortuous approval processes.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="exclusionary-zoning">Exclusionary Zoning</h3>

    <p>Before the twentieth century, most cities and towns in the United States combined some of the following on their streets: "detached" (or "single family") homes, duplexes, quadplexes, row houses, townhomes, and low-rise apartment buildings.</p>

    <p>Exclusionary zoning changed this. It was invented by segregationists in St. Louis, who realized that if you could keep even the smallest of apartments or duplexes out of a neighborhood, there was a very good change you could keep Black and poor people out as well.</p>

    <p>The idea of exclusionary zoning, sometimes called "single family zoning," caught fire, and was replicated in cities and towns across the country in the first half of the century.</p>

    <p>And starting in the sixties and seventies, many cities—including Asheville—practiced "downzoning," where neighborhoods that previously had apartments and other multi-family dwellings were banned from any new such construction. Such downzoning can be understood as a component of the infamous "white flight" that was in part a reaction to the civil rights movement.</p>

    <p>Over time, this meant that cities like Asheville actually <em>lost</em> their capacity to house people.</p>

    <p>Exclusionary zoning is arguably Asheville's biggest factor in our city's housing inequality. Much of the city's residential land is off limits but anything but single family homes, and this severely restricts the amount and the kinds of housing that can be built. It favors the wealthy, and by further restricting the housing supply, it further rewards those who lucked into generational housing wealth, and it stacks the deck against the young, the poor, the nonwhite, and really anyone that has needed to migrate from one place to another.</p>

    <p>As long as housing is scarce at all housing types and sizes, anyone with the means to do so will buy or rent anywhere they can. In other words, a shortage in one kind of housing style or size has a ripple effect, pushing rents and prices up for the whole region.</p>

    <p>And who benefits from this? The same kinds of people that instituted exclusionary zoning a century ago. Their housing wealth has risen through the roof. And it will stay that way as long as exclusionary zoning protects their "investments."</p>

   <p>Some kinds of land use zoning are good, and to say that we need to abolish exclusionary zoning does not mean that we are against regulations. But if we understand this particular regulation as rooted in the past privileges of the prejudiced and the powerful, it only makes sense to right this wrong by eliminating exclusionary zoning from the city's <a href="#unified-development-ordinance">UDO</a> and <a href="#upzoning">upzoning</a> Asheville.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="filtering">Filtering</h3>

    <p>In 2021, used car prices skyrocketed. The reason? A supply shortage limited the production of new cars. And when new cars became scarce, more buyers turned to used cars. So supply went down, and demand went up.</p>

    <p>The process by which new cars become used cars is an instance of filtering. Cars "filter" down from more affluent owners to less ones.</p>
    
    <p>Consider this: No one gets mad because the government or corporations don't make "affordable cars." Instead, cars become naturally more affordable as they age. We expect that a new car will filter down from one population to another.</p>

    <p>Now we can quibble about whether this is the most just economy we can envision, but the fact is that this is how things have worked for some time. And we didn't need to think too much about it until used cars suddenly became scarce and expensive.</p>

    <p>The same goes for housing. For much of the modern era, this is simply how housing worked in most cities. A building costs money to build, and so builders and owners might charge higher rents and prices when a building is new. As housing stock ages, its value lowers, as newer housing pushes it down the filtering path.</p>

    <p>In other words, the fact that houses go up in value, rather than down, should strike us as rather unexpected. It seems like the filtering process has been broken for a while.</p>

    <p>What caused it to break down? Just as with used cars in 2021, the problem is with the supply of new stock. And since land is a limiting factor, the problem is that land use codes limit the new supply of housing on any given chunk of land.</p>

    <p>In short, the problem is <a href="#exclusionary-zoning">exclusionary zoning</a> and other restrictions.</p>

    <p>A breakdown in filtering hurts just about everyone but the wealthy. In 2021, all kinds of used cars went up in price and became harder to find, frustrating all kinds of working people, middle class families, and young people. When one kind of car is unavailable, people go for a different type or style, as long as they can afford it. Similarly, exclusionary zoning sends ripple effects through the housing market, raising prices and limiting choices for all kinds of residents and families.</p>

    <p>So even if you might not picture yourself in a <a href="missing-middle">missing middle</a> type of home, you should support housing abundance—more supply, and more housing types. Because that's how filtering works.</p>

    <p>Understanding filtering makes it easier to understand why we focus on more housing for ALL: ALL people, family sizes, income levels, and ALL housing types. Amidst housing scarcity, filtering won't restore low prices and rents overnight. But when we get greater supply and housing options at the scale of a city or region, filtering has the potential to benefit a far greater number of people than do vouchers or subsidies.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="gentrification">Gentrification</h3>

    <p>By its simplest definition, gentrification means displacement. It's what happens when people in a neighborhood can no longer afford to live in a neighborhood or city because their rents go up, or because they need to move from their house to another house, but they can no longer find an affordable house in their neighborhood.</p>

    <p>In short, gentrification is caused by housing scarcity. When a lot of people are vying for a small number of houses or apartments, the landlord or seller can charge more. And if an individual, couple, or family moves to a new region where housing is in scarce supply—a region like Asheville's—they are more likely to settle somewhere where rents and prices are on the rise. If enough families do the same, this pushes prices up further. Because new housing isn't being built to keep up with demand, there's nothing to stop the prices from doing so.</p>

    <p>There's a lot of confusion about what gentrification is. Some people will tell you that gentrification is whenever white people move into a historically Black neightborhood. Or they'll tell you that it's when amenities such as bike paths are provided in poorer neighborhoods. Or they'll say that it's when working men and women from the tech industry decide to move to your town.</p>

    <p>All these definitions are flawed, confused, and often dangerous, mistaking the symptoms of gentrification for its causes. For example, when people blame tech industry workers for gentrification, this only pits common people against one another while leaving the powerful free from blame. And the idea that bringing  amenities to struggling neighborhoods is the cause of gentrification simply leads to the maintenance of such neighborhoods in segregation and poverty.</p>

    <p><a href="#upzoning">Upzoning</a> can act as a pressure valve, to release the forces causing rents to rise in a neighborhood, and thus stalling gentrification. And over time, upzoning over an entire city or region will promote <a href="#filtering">filtering</a>. (This is important, as historically when <em>only</em> struggling neighborhoods are upzoned, and not the nearby wealthier neighborhoods, there is the potential for a short term effect on prices that harms disadvantaged families.)</p>
    
    <p>Upzoning might be the most important tool that we have to fight gentrification, although the prospects for <a href="#social-housing">social housing</a> should not be neglected either.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="inclusionary-zoning">Inclusionary Zoning</h3>

    <p>This one is a bit misleading. Inclusionary zoning isn't the opposite of <a href="#exclusionary-zoning">exclusionary zoning</a>; it's not really zoning at all. Rather, it's a set of policies that governments use to encourage private <a href="#developer">developers</a> to make their new housing construction more affordable.</p>

    <p>The specifics of inclusionary zoning can look different from place to place, but generally it means that builders will be required to set aside some of the units in an apartment building for particular rental rates, for a set amount of time after that building is finished, if the builder wants to build above a certain height, or above a certain number of housing units.</p>

    <p>Or inclusionary zoning might not be a mandate, but rather an incentive that rewards a developer for making some percentage of units for rent at a rate lower than what the market will bear.</p>

    <p>Inclusionary zoning sounds great, but it turns out to be rather complicated, and pro-housing advocates are split on its efficacy. Some studies suggest that some variations of inclusionary zoning punish small builders, and in other cases developers have been seen to raise the rates on some of their units to compensate for the lower rates of others. In extreme cases, cities have used inclusionary zoning as a trojan horse to try to reduce the pace of overall new construction. In other words, in the wrong hands, inclusionary zoning can be a weapon <i>against</i> housing abundance.</p>

    <p>We're going to be honest: we don't have a solid position on inclusionary zoning at the moment. The devil in this case is in the details, and the NC state government has restricted certain kinds of inclusionary zoning from being used at the municipal level.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="livability">Livability</h3>

    <p>When we talk about neighborhoods, livability, sustainability, and walkability are all buzz-words that mean about the same thing. To what degree does your community allow, and encourage, living without having to get into your car?</p>

    <p>The idea is that different communities, built around different land use patterns, foster different kinds of behavior. If our schools and grocery stores are in walking distance to us, we're more likely to walk there. This saves us gas money, makes our air cleaner, and makes us feel better too.</p>

    <p>It's not just about distance. Are there ample sidewalks, or bike lanes? Do our streets feel welcoming to pedestrians? Do commercial spaces have parking lots in the front, or on the side? All these factors can make or break a community's livability.</p>

    <p>Think about how it feels to walk down Haywood Road in West Asheville, versus Merrimon Avenue in North Asheville, versus Tunnel Road in East Asheville. Or think about other cities that you've visited. Which areas seem most livable? Where would you like to spend more time? And doesn't it make sense to build more housing in the desirable places that are already livable, while also transforming the places that aren't livable yet?</p>

    <p>We know that livable communities aren't just better for our souls and pocket books, but they are a necessity for pursuing environmental justice and mitigating climate catastrophe. And we know that abolishing <a href="#exclusionary-zoning">exclusionary zoning</a>, <a href="#upzoning">upzoning</a>, and pursuing missing <a href="missing-middle">middle housing</a> and <a href="#mixed-use">mixed use</a> spaces are all essential for building livable places.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="luxury-housing">Luxury Housing</h3>

    <p>Why does it seem like all new buildings to rent or own are described as "luxury housing," pitched at well-off buyers and tenants?</p>

    <p>There's two reasons.</p>

    <p>First, in some cases, "luxury" housing is <em>complete</em> nonsense. It's a branding gimmick, and it doesn't really describe any kind of common or regulated standard. The government doesn't regulate what "luxury" means—it's not like buying "organic."</p>

    <p>In fact, in some cities "luxury housing" is total junk.</p>

    <p>Here's the second reason. It costs money to acquire land and to build buildings. And so anyone that goes through the building process is going to want to make that money back. And new housing has its benefits—it has to meet tighter standards for safety and energy efficiency, for example.</p>

    <p>When luxury homes or apartments have been around a little while, they stop being called luxury. This phenomenon is called <a href="#filtering">filtering, and you should read all about it.</a></p>

    <p>But in short, we need new homes to be built, even so-called "luxury" homes, for two reasons: first, the luxury homes of today will be homes for all kinds of people tomorrow. And second, having more homes available for people to choose from, even if they cost more, allows buyers that can afford them to move into those homes instead of other homes that may be needed by other tenants or buyers.</p>

    <p>Now this doesn't mean that Asheville For All wants "McMansions"! We should push the city to ensure that all kinds of housing for all kinds of people are built in ways that foster livability, sustainability, and interconnectedness in our neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>We should also explore ways to make "luxurious" <a href="#social-housing">"social housing</a> a reality too.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="missing-middle">The Missing Middle</h3>

    <p>In North American cities, there's a strange phenonemon that is much less common in other countries. Big cities, and cities such as Asheville too, have a lot of detached, single-family homes. And they also have large apartment buildings, and high rise apartments and condominiums. But they don't have the kinds of rowhomes, townhouses, duplexes, quadplexes, and courtyard complexes that you might find in old Chicago or New York neighborhoods, or more commonly in Paris or London, where three or four story buildings are more the norm.</p>

    <p>This missing group of housing is what we now call the "missing middle."</p>

    <p>There's something odd about this. After all, if you watch a movie or TV show set in a charming locale, or if you want to go on vacation to somewhere with a walkable, vibrant culture, you're probably thinking about somewhere with middle-style housing types. Studies from urban planners and sociologists show that neighborhoods with missing middle housing are more <a href="#livability">livable</a>, more vibrant, and are better for the environment too.</p>

    <p>The reason American cities like Asheville don't have more missing middle housing can be traced simply back to <a href="#exclusionary-zoning">exclusionary zoning</a> and related restrictions, like parking minimums and setback requirements.</p>

    <p>But that doesn't answer why we have single family homes on one end of the spectrum, but large high rise residential buildings on the other.</p>

    <p>The answer has to do with the process by which <a href="#developer">developers</a> can request exceptions to zoning codes. TK TK</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="overpopulation-myth">The Overpopulation Myth</h3>

    <p>Lorem Ipsim Whateverum</p>

    <!-- https://www.theworldmind.org/home/2021/12/10/the-dangerous-myth-of-overpopulation https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/population-growth-housing-climate-change/629952/ -->

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="social-housing">Social Housing</h3>

    <p>When you think about public housing, you might think about the isolating structure types called "towers in the park" of New York City, or here in Asheville, of the communities tucked away behind highways or on hilltops.</p>

    <p>Social housing has some similarities to public housing. It is owned and operated by the government, or by a nonprofit entity, and is intended to better serve the needs of people. But social housing has its own history, mostly outside of the United States.</p>

    <p>One key difference is that social housing is built for all kinds of family needs and income levels. The money paid by higher income residents subsidizes the housing for lower income ones. But because the housing is all non-profit, all of the residents benefit from living in social housing.</p>

    <p>Contemporary social housing projects are decidedly not tucked away behind highways, nor are they constructed at inhuman scales. A good social housing development should incorporate <a href="#missing-middle">"missing middle"</a> style housing types, prioritize integration with existing neighborhoods, <a href="#livability">livability</a>, and easy access to public transit.</p>

    <p>In other words, social housing should promote and lead to more housing abundance. We suspect that <a href="#upzoning">upzoning</a> might be a necessary precursor to social housing here in Asheville, since we'll need the city's people to be generally on board with more housing varieties and choices in our existing neighborhoods if social housing has a chance of taking root in those neighborhoods. But there's no doubt that we should fight for social housing as one pillar of a platform for housing abundance.</p>

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="transit-oriented-development">Transit Oriented Development</h3>

    <p>
If we want to maximize the efficiency and efficacy of our public transit, and see ridership grow, we need to have more homes, jobs, schools, businesses, and amenities close to transit stops. That means growing density near those stops, especially within a quarter mile of each one.
    </p>
    <p>That's the main idea behind transit oriented development ("TOD"). It means prioritizing the "nodes" and "corridors" that make up transit systems when you're aiming for urban growth.</p>
    <p>
        And this makes perfect sense. We should have more three and four story apartment buildings and commercial businesses on Merrimon Avenue and Tunnel Road before we started putting them on out-of-way mountaintops or deep in sleepier neighborhoods.
    </p>
    <p>(TOD might also ensure that such developments on Tunnel Road reorient parking lots to the sides and backs of new buildings, so that the streetscape is much more welcoming and friendly to pedestrians than it is at present.)</p>
    <p>
        Sounds simple, right? But you'd be surprised at how often a train station in a large city will be surrounded not by homes and businesses, but by parking lots and highways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or how when planning where cities should build up density, people don't take into account where the bus stops are.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Asheville, it seems like this a no-brainer. We can make it easier to get around without a car, and become more environmentally sustainable and help fight the climate crisis in the process.</p>
        <p>So why, for example, isn't there more housing near the downtown bus station and the adjacent neighborhoods?
    </p>
    <p>
        If you guessed the answer is <a href="#exclusionary-zoning">exclusionary zoning</a> (and related restrictions such as parking minimums) then you've been reading some of the other entries on this page! Congratulations. Yes, it turns out that people will use the "not in my backyard" complaint even when that neighborhood is perfectly suited for transit oriented development.

    <h3 class="glossary-entry" id="unified-development-ordinance">The Unified Development Ordinance (UDO)</h3>

    <p>All of Asheville's zoning codes and regulations live in one place: the Unified Development Ordinance, or UDO. (Technically, it constitutes "Chapter Seven" of Asheville's ordinances, and <a target="_blank" href="https://library.municode.com/nc/asheville/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH7DE">you can read it yourself here.)</a></p>
    <p>This is the document that defines not only where zoning is excluded to detached single family homes, but also where other restrictions like parking minimums, minimum lot sizes, and height restrictions combine to make affordable and sustainable neighborhoods much more difficult to create.</p>
    <p>As of this writing, the UDO hasn't been significantly revised since the 1990s.</p>
    <p>And since it's woefully outdated, that means that Asheville isn't growing to match the demand of a growing population for more housing. It also doesn't reflect current ideas around how to build a resilient, sustainable, and environmentally just city in the midst of our climate catastrophe.</p>
    <p>The UDO is the law. But it's not the alpha and omega for development in Asheville. This is where exceptions, or variances, come in.</p>
    <p>Any builder can make a request on the city for an exception to the rules. For example, if you want to build an apartment complex on a vacant site that used to be used for industrial purposes, you would request a variance to use that site for a residential building.</p>
    <p>(This is in contrast to building <i>within</i> the limits of the zoning codes, which is called building "by right.")</p>
    <p>But the process for seeing a variance successfully approved is hard. It can take a long time, and cost a lot of money. This makes sense, after all, it is breaking the rules. Again, the problem is that those rules are outdated.</p>
    <p>The fact that the process for variances is difficult and costly has a deleterious effect: it means that only very big projects with big potential earnings are likely to be proposed through this process. After all, builders need deep pockets to navigate it. This is one of the reasons why Asheville, like other cities, can be said to suffer from a "<a href="missing-middle">missing middle.</a>"</p>
